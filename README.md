### **Details**

My project contains - 
1) frontend and backend folder contains code of respective side of project.
2) install.sh - all the dependencies  are specified here.
3) server_run.sh - Once the required software is installed using install.sh, the server_run.sh will be invoked to get your backend server up and running.
4) sleep.sh - Once the server_run.sh is invoked (in the background), it may take a while to be up and running.  so here  the number of seconds is specified , that I would like to wait (before the curl commands are run from test_server.sh) in this sleep.sh file.
